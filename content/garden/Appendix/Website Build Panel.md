### Want to build a personal website?

#### Motivation
- Build an internet presence
- Practice and develop web dev. skills


#### Tools
- Considered a few different ones. Looks like [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-1/), and [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) might be good options.
- Although [this](https://github.com/mathieudutour/gatsby-digital-garden/)uses Gatsby and follows Andy's formatting, the output looks thematically pretty good. Depending on Netlify's pricing, Obsidian's built in publish tools might be more convenient. 

#### Steps
- [x] [[Setting up Gatsby]]
- [x] Create site using [Gatsby Digital Garden](https://github.com/mathieudutour/gatsby-digital-garden/)
- [x] Have sample markdown notes ready [[Sample Note Ideas]]
- [x] Host Gatsby on Netlify including pushing code to Github
- [ ] Move to learning web dev basics [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#responsive-web-design-projects) and [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) #javascript #html
