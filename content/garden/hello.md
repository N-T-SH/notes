# Hello!

This is an experiment in thinking out loud. It is structured with connections instead of hierarchies and chronologies. Often referred to as Digital Gardens, [Maggie Appleton](https://github.com/maggieappleton/digital-gardeners) has an excellent resource compilation. Inspired by [Andy](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/) and built using [Gatsby Theme Garden](https://github.com/mathieudutour/gatsby-digital-garden/).
