title:Â "LIDAR"

---
Lucid's been in the news recently for it's LIDAR enabled Driver assist systems. Elon Musk has called LIDAR a [crutch](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/04/teslas-autonomy-event-impressive-progress-with-an-unrealistic-timeline/), claiming that it does not add value in visual recognition and will eventually be discarded by automakers. 

Visual recognition allows an autonomous vehicle to identify objects in its' environment. A red stop light and the the brake light of a semi should mean different things to an autonomous vehicle, one of them could still be moving. The vehicle might want to slow down regardless. 

And while this is true, autonomy would entail mupltiple related tasks. Depth perception is it's own problem. Systems based purely a camera signal aren't there yet.  
Apple uses a version of this in their phones, if we can't trust the depth info for taking photographers how are we supposed to rely on it to identify obstacles.

All said and done, having orthogonal signals might be a good thing. One company should not be in a position to dictate where the market goes. Specially when they're looking after their bottom line and LIDAR sensors currently cost multiple K's.  

And while it is true that NHTSA would be regulating this their is a lot happening and a lot of intricacies. ML engineers working on autonomous vehicles don't have a standards body like Civil or structural Engineers do. Those orgs. are important to ensure a foundational quality in these systems. 

Press notes do say that the current system 'Dream Drive Pro' - enables 21-speaker assisted 


Competition might just be a good thing. It's not that it won't be there, when we look at the global market. See Honda's Level 3 system and all these Chinese companies. Why having multiple healthy compeitors in the western market might be a post for another day.
